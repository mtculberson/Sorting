# Sorting
Java project that sorts arrays (using selection, bubble and insertion sort), then counts how long each sorting method takes.

There are selection, bubble and insertion sort methods for printing each swap along the sorting process. Then there are seperate sorting methods to track the amount of time that each method takes. 

One of my methods fill the arrays that will be timed in decreasing order (9999, 9998, ... , 1, 0). The purpose of having such lengthy arrays to time how long the sorting will take is to get an accurate representation of how long each sorting method takes on a large scale.
